# HLI-beefcattle-welfare-seasonal-projections
Python scripts to compute seasonal Heat Load Index (HLI) on a 0.25Â° global grid from NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 (tas, hurs, rsds, sfcWind), build an equal-weighted 27-GCM ensemble, and render welfare category maps for CliNO (1985-2014) and CMIP6 projections (2026-2100). Outputs: CF-compliant NetCDF and publication-ready figures.
